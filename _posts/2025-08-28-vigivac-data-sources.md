<h5>VigiVac Data Sources</h5>
<p>The VigiVac project integrates three major Brazilian health information systems, each of which captures a distinct dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic response: mild cases (SG), severe cases (SRAG), and vaccination records (PNI). Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of exposure, disease progression, and immunization coverage across the country.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Flu Syndrome (SG – Síndrome Gripal)</b></p>
<p>Data on flu-like illness are derived from the e-SUS Notifica system, which registers suspected cases of Flu Syndrome (SG) associated with COVID-19. This system primarily covers outpatient encounters, providing information on the patient’s place of residence, site of notification, laboratory test results, demographic characteristics, and reported clinical symptoms. SG surveillance is essential for capturing milder forms of COVID-19, which may not result in hospitalization but are critical for understanding infection dynamics at the community level.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAG)</b></p>
<p>The SRAG surveillance system has been operated by the Ministry of Health’s Secretariat of Health Surveillance since the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Initially embedded in the influenza and respiratory virus sentinel networks, it was later expanded to systematically monitor severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Each SRAG record contains detailed demographic data (age, sex, residence), disease-related information (etiological agent, reported symptoms, laboratory test results), and treatment information (prescribed medications, procedures performed, and clinical outcomes). Unlike SG, SRAG focuses on hospitalized or severe cases, making it crucial for studying the burden of severe disease and vaccine protection against hospitalization and death.</p>

<br>

<p><b>National Vaccination Campaign against COVID-19 (PNI)</b></p>
<p>The National Immunization Program (PNI) of the Ministry of Health provides open access to detailed records from the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign. These data include the number of doses administered, disaggregated by state, municipality, date, sex, age group, and vaccine type. The database covers the four vaccines deployed in Brazil—AstraZeneca, CoronaVac, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Janssen—and represents the foundation for evaluating vaccine coverage and effectiveness at both population and subgroup levels.</p>
