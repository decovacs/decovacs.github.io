				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems, particularly those of low- and middle-income countries. Brazil is the second worst hit country in the world, with 620,238 COVID-related deaths in 213 million population. South Asia is home to a quarter of the world’s population and a COVID-19 hotspot; India has the third-highest caseload in the world (484,655 deaths), and Pakistan the third highest in Asia (28,987 deaths) – much lower than Brasil with similar population (225 million). South Asian ethnicity is associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19 and related mortality, and understanding real-world differences in the pandemic will support future preparedness.</p>
				<p>As the pandemic continues, vaccination efforts have taken focus. A full picture of COVID-19’s vaccine safety and effectiveness globally and in South Asia and Latin America in particular is needed. Some countries were able to leverage the National Health System Data to rapidly generate relevant evidence on vaccine effectiveness using real-world data, including Chile, Israel and Brazil and multi-cohort analysis in Brazil and Scotland.</p>
				<p>Evidence from Global South will be important to monitor effectiveness of vaccines used worldwide, particularly considering the ethnicity groups, pregnancy, and the novel Variants of Concern (VOC) in each country. Most of the countries will lack national health system data and will rely on healthcare facilities data, such as Pakistan. Evidence is needed from countries in both situations. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital in Pakistan (SKM) has experience with electronic health records and use of common data models for research. This project will reuse existing data on COVID-19 in both countries for comparative vaccine effectiveness analysis.</p>
				<p>With Brazil and Pakistan aiming to fully vaccinate just under half a billion people in total, terabytes of valuable data are being generated daily. A framework for comparative analysis of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in different scenarios could foster evidence generation and provide the basis for further comparative analysis in the global south. Common barriers include limitations of safe and fair data curation, lack of standardised and open tools and analytics, reproducibility, and global and local contextualisation of findings.</p>
				<p>We propose a model for rapid, reproducible, and open COVID-19 evidence generation through re-use of existing data. Our team together with the worldwide OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics - OHDSI) community has led a federated distributed network analysis relying on mapping of participating data sources to the OMOP common data model (CDM), and on the distribution of analytical code to be run locally on the readily mapped data by each of the data partners in the network 8. This strategy has progressively gained credibility as a best-practice model to conduct international research in a rapid, transparent, and reproducible manner. We aim to leverage this for a data re-use study that will crosscut the data governance and capacity building cores. We will adapt OHDSI data science standards and tools for a global data-science ecosystem.</p>
