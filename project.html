				<span class="text-color h5 text-uppercase">Executive Summary</span>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems, particularly those of low- and middle-income countries. Brazil is the second worst hit country in the world, with 620,238 COVID-related deaths in 213 million population. South Asia is home to a quarter of the world’s population and a COVID-19 hotspot; India has the third-highest caseload in the world (484,655 deaths), and Pakistan the third highest in Asia (28,987 deaths) – much lower than Brasil with similar population (225 million). South Asian ethnicity is associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19 and related mortality, and understanding real-world differences in the pandemic will support future preparedness.</p>
				<p>As the pandemic continues, vaccination efforts have taken focus. A full picture of COVID-19’s vaccine safety and effectiveness globally and in South Asia and Latin America in particular is needed. Some countries were able to leverage the National Health System Data to rapidly generate relevant evidence on vaccine effectiveness using real-world data, including Chile, Israel and Brazil and multi-cohort analysis in Brazil and Scotland.</p>
				<p>Evidence from Global South will be important to monitor effectiveness of vaccines used worldwide, particularly considering the ethnicity groups, pregnancy, and the novel Variants of Concern (VOC) in each country. Most of the countries will lack national health system data and will rely on healthcare facilities data, such as Pakistan. Evidence is needed from countries in both situations. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital in Pakistan (SKM) has experience with electronic health records and use of common data models for research. This project will reuse existing data on COVID-19 in both countries for comparative vaccine effectiveness analysis.</p>
				<p>With Brazil and Pakistan aiming to fully vaccinate just under half a billion people in total, terabytes of valuable data are being generated daily. A framework for comparative analysis of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in different scenarios could foster evidence generation and provide the basis for further comparative analysis in the global south. Common barriers include limitations of safe and fair data curation, lack of standardised and open tools and analytics, reproducibility, and global and local contextualisation of findings.</p>
				<p>We propose a model for rapid, reproducible, and open COVID-19 evidence generation through re-use of existing data. Our team together with the worldwide OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics - OHDSI) community has led a federated distributed network analysis relying on mapping of participating data sources to the OMOP common data model (CDM), and on the distribution of analytical code to be run locally on the readily mapped data by each of the data partners in the network. This strategy has progressively gained credibility as a best-practice model to conduct international research in a rapid, transparent, and reproducible manner. We aim to leverage this for a data re-use study that will crosscut the data governance and capacity building cores. We will adapt OHDSI data science standards and tools for a global data-science ecosystem.</p>

				<span class="text-color h5 text-uppercase">Specific Goals</span>
				<p>Our overall aim is to develop a rapid, reproducible, and open data re-use model for policy-relevant COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness research in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on vaccine effectiveness and early warnings of local outbreaks that take local social deprivation into account.</p>
				<p>As such, the proposed model must be adaptable to different local health systems scenarios and able to run on top of existing routinely collected data. In order to do that, we will re-use available data on COVID-19 infection, hospitalisations, deaths and on the vaccination roll-out to run a comparative analysis of the COVID-19 Vaccines effectiveness on Brazil and Pakistan, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM).</p>
				<p>We will disseminate the model to anyone who takes interest by means of open science strategies. We will leverage our extensive experience in OHDSI data science tools, standards, and processes for this <sup>8,9,11,12</sup>.</p>
				<p>We will have trainings and workshops between the Brazil and Pakistan teams, in coordination with international experts from the University of Oxford. The OMOP mapped Brazil and Pakistan datasets will be ripe and rich and available for federated analysis.</p>
				<p>We will provide detailed process documentation on our mapping and standardizing of administrative and clinical data available in both countries, including the extract, transformation, load (ETL) process, open-source coding, and documentation in public repositories, such as GITHub, as well as on FAIR processes. Comparative data quality and statistical analysis will leverage OHDSI data science tools such as the Data Quality Dashboard, Patient Level Prediction Package, ATLAS Interface and Cohort Diagnostics.</p>
				<p>The team will be able to support the development of reusable training materials and handbooks, as well as to participate in other related collaborative analysis, capacity strengthening and data governance efforts.</p>

				<span class="text-color h5 text-uppercase">Link with Ongoing Initiatives and Resources</span>
				<p>Our team is running a COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Surveillance Platform (<a href="https://vigivac.fiocruz.br">https://vigivac.fiocruz.br</a>), and we already have been able to run comparative analysis in cooperation with other countries before 7. There are three other relevant ongoing initiatives related to COVID-19: the development of a Social Disparities Index for COVID-19; the development of an analytical dashboard for COVID-19 data in Brazil and a cooperative mapping of COVID-19 Brazilian and Pakistani databases to OMOP-CDM. Building on top of these initiatives we will map available data on COVID-19 vaccination status of patients and employees of SKM to run comparative analysis on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and surveillance in Brazil and Pakistan.</p>
				<p>This model will feed into and leverage at least three ongoing initiatives within Grand Challenges network: the development of Covid-19 social deprivation dashboard: https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/evaluating-effects-social-inequalities-covid-19-pandemic-low-and-middle-income-country-lmic , Mapping of Brazil and Pakistan Covid-19 data to a common data model: <a href="https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/real-world-evidence-pakistan-manage-covid-19-global-south">https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/real-world-evidence-pakistan-manage-covid-19-global-south</a> and <a href="https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/real-world-evidence-brazil-manage-covid-19-global-south">https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/real-world-evidence-brazil-manage-covid-19-global-south</a>.
				<p>These initiatives and resources assure access to the databases needed for this proposal, as well as that the team has the required expertise in public health, epidemiology, data management and data science.</p>
