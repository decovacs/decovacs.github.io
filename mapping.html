				<p>Mapping of the SKM and CIDACS data to the OMOP CDM is in progress through an ongoing BMGF project, with technical guidance from Oxford and colleagues from OHDSI. Next, SKM and CIDACS will run the analytical tools for the objectives of this study on their mapped data and share aggregated results, without sharing patient-level data. Brazil and Pakistan teams will pool results from SKM with those from global datasets and prepare materials for dissemination, including manuscripts, study reports, and interactive web applications. Our recent COVID-19 multi-national research has demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of this strategy (https://www.ohdsi.org/covid-19-updates/) to inform the COVID-19 crisis with findings changing international guidelines and regulatory safety warnings<sup>8,9,11,12</sup>.</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-3">Data Sources:</h3>
				<span class="text-color h5 text-uppercase">Pakistan database (data access approvals in place)</span>
				<p>SKMCH&RC is a 195-bed secondary and tertiary care hospital in Lahore, Pakistan that provides cancer and non-cancer care (is a focal point for COVID-19 cases). SKM’s electronic health records database contains electronic medical records from over 7.8 million people (of which 52.7% are female) from all five ethnically distinct provinces in Pakistan (including Afghanistan ethnicity). It contains anonymised data on socio-demographics, laboratory results, clinical diagnoses, outcomes, prescriptions, hospital inpatient procedures, and mortality data from December 1994 to present. As of November 2020 SKM contained records for 20,840 COVID-19 positive patients, 105,550 cancer patients, and 621 cancer patients who were COVID-19 positive, and related COVID-19 vaccination records. For use in health data science, the database has been mapped to the OMOP CDM through an ongoing BMGF-funded study.</p>

				<span class="text-color h5 text-uppercase">Brazil database (data access approvals in place)</span>
				<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIDACS / Fiocruz (Brazilian centre for big health data linkage, 70+ staff) has been developing COVID-19 research using the State of Bahia data (15 million people) to build analytical dashboards, a COVID-19 vulnerability index and modelling the disease spreading and burden. In 2021 CIDACS began the surveillance of COVID-19 effectiveness using  massive database with the three deterministically linked national datasets of 2020 and 2021: COVID-19 Vaccination campaign that administered 353 million doses (SI-PNI); Acute Respiratory Infection Suspected Cases (e-SUS-Notifica), which holds clinical and laboratory data from all 60 million suspected cases and contact tracing; and the records of the 2 million Severe Acute Respiratory Infection/Illness (SIVEP-Gripe), which includes all COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths. 164.3 million individuals were linked for this cohort studies (https://vigivac.fiocruz.br ). The research protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee.</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-3">Stakeholders and community engagement: </h3>
				<p>Our initiative will be based on engagement and involvement strategies to allow a relationship with specific stakeholders. We will elaborate different communication pieces and actions to support this dialogue with target groups, like policymakers, communities’ groups, researchers, national and international COVID-19 task forces (BMGF, WHO, World Bank, UN, Unesco, etc.), patients, practitioners, and civil society.</p>
				<p>We will explore our mailing list with more than 1000 contacts of these stakeholders to start this dialogue. Individual conversations and focus groups will be important to exchange information between researchers and policymakers or researchers and communities’ groups. Webinars will re-join our target groups. In addition, we can continue the dialogue through social media, e-mail, and online forms. The stakeholders engaged on this project will share their daily experience with our team, give us some insights to new analysis, and validate results.</p>
				<p>Besides that, our study steering committee will include up to four patients and public representatives representing diverse ethnic groups. They will support the project on our public and patient involvement and case study activities to discuss use of data and advise on each project step. They will also help to share the findings in local communities.</p>
				<p>We hope this work will be of national and global significance and will share our findings in the planned web application (https://vigivac.fiocruz.br/), preprints, and scientific high-impact journal articles, and with the Brazil and Pakistan government’s pandemic response task forces, respective Ministries of Health, World Health Organization, BMGF, national and international regulatory bodies and other international stakeholders through established channels.</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-3">Path to impact:</h3>
				<p>The main immediate anticipated impact will be the timely generation of data-driven evidence, localized to Brazil and Pakistan on COVID-19 and vaccine effectiveness, which in turn will determine the state of future preparedness for upcoming waves and variants. However, the over-arching impact will be the creation of an eco-system for observational research including and beyond COVID-19, as well as the use of our findings in national and regional COVID-19 public health strategies and guidelines in Pakistan and Brazil. The findings will contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 in two large countries from the Global South. The Pakistan-Brazil collaboration will facilitate the extended use of data re-use model to problems beyond COVID-19 e.g. other infectious diseases, diabetes, cancer (particularly in females), and childhood nutrition.</p>
				<p>Aside from the impact within 18 months, Brazil and Pakistan teams will receive OMOP mapping workshops. Via that the teams will be equipped to use their mapped routinely collected data for research to address critical questions of local and global importance. These include issues relevant to LMIC e.g. diabetes, cancer, infectious diseases, maternal health, long term impact of childhood nutritional gaps, and links of each with environmental factors. 2) The above will better be answered with a broader range of data, with greater representation. We aim to extend OMOP-mapping to national level databases, and linkage of primary, secondary, registry databases in the future. In doing so we hope to foster a culture of collaborative, real-world health data science in these two countries from the Global South.</p>
